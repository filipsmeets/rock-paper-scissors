# rock-paper-scissors
I've made an implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. For the moment the game plays from the browser console, but I will revisit this project in a later phase and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text.
You will play a 5 round game against the computer after which you will get the result who has won.
